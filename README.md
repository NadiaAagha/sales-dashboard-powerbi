# 📊 Sales Dashboard (2022–2024)

This Power BI project provides a detailed analysis of company sales performance between **2022 and 2024**.  
It visualizes revenue, costs, quantities, and brand-wise trends to help identify top-performing categories and profitable regions.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

The company had sales data spread across multiple Excel files, making it difficult to track:
- Which product categories and brands were generating the most revenue
- How costs and sales varied across states
- Where improvements were needed in low-performing categories

To solve this, I designed an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that cleans, combines, and visualizes the sales data in a single, easy-to-understand view.
